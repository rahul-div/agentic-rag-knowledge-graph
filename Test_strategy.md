Your task is to go through the planning.md file and the task.md file to implement every task correctly, in the right order, ensuring all required functionalities of the project are correctly implemented.
Thorough Testing of Initial Tasks:
Some tasks in the task.md file are marked as done, but don’t assume they are correctly implemented.
Thoroughly test each task marked as done to verify the implementation is correct.
Only mark tasks as done after comprehensive testing, ensuring the functionality works as expected.
Do Not Rush:
Do not rush to implement tasks or mark them as done.
If important tests fail, don’t bypass them or mark the functionality as working just to please me.
You are here to correctly implement every functionality of the project, not to meet arbitrary deadlines.
Refer to Official Documentation:
Always refer to the official documentation links found in the initial.md file whenever necessary.
Ensure you follow the official guidelines and best practices.
Take Your Time:
Carefully implement each task, one by one, ensuring proper testing, debugging, and validation.
If any issues arise, document them and take the time to fix them before moving forward.
Testing & Validation:
Each task should have appropriate tests (unit tests, integration tests, etc.) associated with it.
Test thoroughly and ensure all functionality works correctly, both independently and in integration.
Implementation & Documentation:
Implement each task following the detailed steps, and make sure you update the documentation where necessary.
Always ensure the implementation matches the requirements outlined in the task.md and planning.mdfiles.
Important Note: You’re not here to simply complete tasks — you're here to ensure that the functionality is correctly implemented. Take your time, test thoroughly, and don’t bypass any critical checks or tests.
